## Application Description

This is a portfolio project, where I am challenging myself to create a responsive virtual keyboard, and a text area to test input. This will be a web application, and be built with React.


## Objective

The keyboard will replicate the key layout of a standard uk board. I will achieve this using CSS-Grid.
Each button on the keyboard will create the corrosponding character when pressed, sending that character to a text on the screen.
The keyboard must also be usable on mobile, for this I will researcg optimal way to display all keys on a small screen.

## What was my Workflow

-   **‚úÖ Create Project Steps** <br>
    A great starting point is to plan ahead, break the plan down into steps.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Research mobile keyboard layout** <br>
    This will allow me to get an idea on how it can be display, since I will be using mobile first design.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Decide on colour palette for the theme** <br>
    Coolors.co is a fantastic App to choose colours for a theme, testing combinations and contrast decided to go with purple hues and picked some cold and warm variations to separate foreground and background.<br>
    You can see my colour theme [here](https://coolors.co/69009e-9e0091-ff00b1-c2a5bc-c1e9f1).

-   **‚úÖ Use github for version control** <br>
    Set up repository on github, and accessed it locally to start work using git commands to regularly add, commit, and push changes to the repository.

-   **‚úÖ Install packages** <br>
    I had an idea what packages I was going to work with based on the features I wanted to include. Working with React, Jest for testing.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Setup file structure** <br>
    For this project I used create-react-app, I re-organised the file structure and began adding javascript files.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Implement keyboard layout and theme** <br>
    Build the layout of the application then apply the colour theme.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Add text area** <br>
    This will be interacted with as the user clicks keys on the virtual keyboard.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Implement state management** <br>
    Here I will add functionality to each key, allowing a an on-press event to trigger character input into the text area

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Add a Light / Dark mode** <br>
    Realising that the theme may not cater for everyone's taste, I chose to add a dark version which also maintained the colour scheme of the app.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Test application** <br>
    I used React testing library with Jest, it's my first time using these both to fully test an application, I chose to do all my testing in one go as I felt that a longer duration of testing would help me get a better understandng of how to implement testing.
    The objective was to test the application from the perspective of how a user would interact with the app, and what they would expect to see when using each and every feature. Ideally, I would be creating my test files and then building the app to the specification of the test files, which is how I intend on approaching my next application, I feel much more confident with testing now.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Check responsive design** <br>
    I want the application to look great on all mobile, tablet and desktop, I used a mobile first css approach.

-   **‚¨úÔ∏è Create a build and deploy to github pages** <br>
    To showcase this application, I will use github pages as its free and easy to setup.
