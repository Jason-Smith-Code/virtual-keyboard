## Application Description

This is a portfolio project, where I am challenging myself to create a responsive virtual keyboard, and a text area to test input from teh keyboard.
This will be a web application, and be built with React.

## Objective

The keyboard will replicate the key layout of a standard uk board. I will achieve this using CSS-Grid.
Each button on the keyboard will create the corrosponding character when pressed, sending that character to a text on the screen.
The keyboard must also be usable on mobile, for this I will research optimal way to display all keys on a small screen.
Once the project is working as intended, I will refactor my code so that it becomes easier to maintain.

## What was my Workflow

- **âœ… Create Project Steps** <br>
  A great starting point is to plan ahead, break the plan down into steps.

- **âœ… Research mobile keyboard layout** <br>
  This will allow me to get an idea on how it can be display, since I will be using mobile first design.

- **âœ… Use github for version control** <br>
  Set up repository on github, and accessed it locally to start work using git commands to regularly add, commit, and push changes to the repository.

- **âœ… Install packages** <br>
  I had an idea what packages I was going to work with based on the features I wanted to include. Working with React, Jest for testing.

- **âœ… Setup file structure** <br>
  For this project I used create-react-app, I re-organised the file structure and began adding javascript files.

- **âœ… Implement keyboard layout** <br>
  Build the layout of the application.

- **âœ… Add text area** <br>
  This will be interacted with as the user clicks keys on the virtual keyboard.

- **âœ… Implement state management** <br>
  Here I will add functionality to each key, allowing a an on-press event to trigger character input into the text area

- **âœ… Check responsive design** <br>
  I want the application to look great on all mobile, tablet and desktop, I used a mobile first css approach.

- **âœ… Create a build and deploy to github pages** <br>
  To showcase this application, I will use github pages as its free and easy to setup.
